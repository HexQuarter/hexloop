# HexLoop

Work becomes value.
Value returns as opportunity.

HexLoop turns completed work into Bitcoin-anchored receipts that power repeat business.

Each paid project can mint a verifiable work receipt.
Clients redeem those receipts for discounts on future projects — creating a continuous loop of collaboration.

Proof of Work becomes Proof of Loyalty.

## Motivation

Most loyalty systems reward spending.
Crypto loyalty often rewards speculation.

HexLoop rewards completed work.

There is no durable mechanism in B2B relationships to:
  •	Tokenize delivered value
  •	Anchor it to Bitcoin
  •	Make it redeemable
  •	Reinforce long-term collaboration

Payments are isolated events.
HexLoop turns them into recurring relationships.

## Our value proposition

HexLoop is a non-custodial system that:
  •	Generates Bitcoin payment requests
  •	Mints work receipts after payment confirmation
  •	Allows clients to redeem receipts for future discounts
  •	Keeps custody with the issuer and the client

Funds never pass through HexLoop.

This is operational real-world asset (oRWA) infrastructure — grounded in delivered work, not speculation.

## The Loop of Work
  1.	Get Paid: Create a Bitcoin payment request and receive funds directly to your wallet.
  2.	Issue a Receipt: Once payment is confirmed, mint a work receipt to your client’s wallet.
  3.	Build Loyalty: Each receipt represents completed work and earned trust.
  4.	Redeem: Clients redeem receipts for discounts on future projects — restarting the loop.

Four steps. One continuous loop.

## Design Principles
  •	Bitcoin-first
  •	Non-custodial by default
  •	Receipts minted only after confirmed payment
  •	No speculation
  •	No financial engineering
  •	No custody of funds
